    <p>
      The main component of the developer's kit is the interface jar. 
      This contains only interfaces and agent developers are expected 
      to code their agents against these. The FglAM runtime will provide
      concrete implementations of these interfaces as needed.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Agent developers must provide one or more concrete implementations of the
      {@link com.quest.glue.api.agent.Agent} interface and may use and of the
      services in the com.quest.glue.api.services package as returned by the
      {@link com.quest.glue.api.services.ServiceFactory} provided to each 
      agent instance in it's constructor.
    
      Agent developers are forbidden from using any other classes in the 
      com.quest.glue package hierarchy.
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>Agent developers must not ship the interface jar with their agent.</strong>
