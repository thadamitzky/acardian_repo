  This is an empty topology file for the %agent.agentName% agent

  Your agent will be able to use all the core topology types (like Host)
  without having to redefine them. It is recommended that you prefix
  all the topology types you do define with your agent type. For example:

  <type name="%agent.agentName%URL" extends="TopologyObject">
      <property name="host"     type="Host"    is-identity="true"/>
      <property name="protocol" type="String"  is-identity="true"/>
      <property name="port"     type="Integer" is-identity="true"/>
      <property name="path"     type="String"  is-identity="true"/>
  </type>

  <type name="%agent.agentName%WebPageInfo" extends="TopologyObject">
     <property name="url"          type="%agent.agentName%URL" is-identity="true"/>
     <property name="responseTime" type="Metric"/>
  </type>
-->
<types>
  <!-- Since building a simulator for the cartridge requires at least on topology type,
       we'll add in a simple example. -->
  <type name='%agent.cartridgeName%ExampleTopologyType' extends='TopologyObject'/>     
</types>
