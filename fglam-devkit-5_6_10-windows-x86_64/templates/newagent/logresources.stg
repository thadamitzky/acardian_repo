logresources(agent) ::= <<
%copyrightproperties(agent.year)%

# These are the log resources used by all classes in the %agent.agentPackage% 
# package.
#
# Each package in which classes need to log at higher that the DEBUG level 
# (i.e. VERBOSE, INFO, WARN, ERROR, or FATAL) will need a LogResources.properties file.
#
# This file can also be localized by creating a copy with the desired locale appended 
# to the file name. LogResources_de.properties for German or LogResources_de_CH.properties 
# for German as it is spoken in Switzerland. The correct log resource bundle will be 
# automatically selected based on the locale the agent is running in. If there is no 
# localized version of the file, then the non-localized version (this file) is selected.
